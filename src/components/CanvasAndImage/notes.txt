?? check if it is better than current approach
in crop we can use dirtyX and dirtyY arguments in putImageData


do we need to work with downscaled image?
check performance with full res image intead and all the logic of downscale can be moved from ImageHelper.editedImageData to CanvasHelper.drawImageFromImageData


we need  to pass
(canvasHelper, ?? optional as it is present in imageHelper as well ) ImageHelper and isImageLoaded to all the components
app is the parent component


maybe move isImageloaded to redux instead of global state


current problem in scaling
canvas size is not changing i think

imageHelper in image data same ref and we should not be able to edit the data directly by reference, either return new iamgedata every time


if (!props.isImageLoaded || props.globalState.imageHelper == undefined) {
            // TODO - display message to user
            console.debug("either Image is not loaded or imageHelper is not intialized yet")
            return;
        }
these condition should be in imagehelper??


make crop div relative to canvas


Adjustment
* temprature
* opacity
* highlights
* shadows


TODO -
* remove all <any>

wrapper object for updating imagedata
